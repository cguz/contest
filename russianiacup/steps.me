Creating of a local game is very simple: 

- start Local runner with the corresponding script (for Windows or *nix system), 
- then run your strategy from the development environment (or using any other method) and watch the game. 

You can debug your strategy using breakpoints during local games. But remember that Local runner waits for response no more than 30 minutes. By the end of this time it will consider your strategy “broken” and continue to work without it.
